File Handler Design

File handler is part of the program that deals with reading files and
returning the raw file contents. It will handle:

    1. Locating the data directory containing mission files
    2. Listing all readable files in the data directory
    3. Reading the contents of a requested file
    4. Handling file-related errors (missing files, invalid input, unreadable files)
    5. Return file data to Program Control

public List<String> getFileList()
    - Returns a sorted list of .txt filenames found in the data folder
    - Filenames are returned without numbers
    - If the folder doesn’t exist or has no files, an empty list is returned

public String readFile(String fileName)
    - Reads the entire contents of the given file and returns it as a String
    - If the file does not exist or can’t be read, an exception is thrown

Errors will be handled using null exceptions.
