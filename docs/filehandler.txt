File Handler Design
Megha Saikrishnan (hfe5ps), Member B, Group 22

File handler is part of the program that deals with reading files and
returning the raw file contents. It will handle:

    1. Locating the data directory containing mission files
    2. Listing all readable .txt files in the data directory
    3. Reading the contents of a requested file
    4. Handling file-related errors (missing files, unreadable files)
    5. Returning file data to Program Control

Public Methods:

public List<String> getFileList()
    - Returns a sorted list of .txt filenames found in the data/ folder
    - Filenames are returned without numbers (just the filename)
    - Files are sorted alphabetically
    - If the folder doesn't exist or has no files, return an empty list

public String readFile(String fileName)
    - Reads the entire contents of the given file and returns it as a String
    - Expects the file to be in the data/ directory
    - If the file does not exist or can't be read, throws an Exception with n
      error message

Error Handling:
    - FileNotFoundException: thrown when requested file doesn't exist
    - IOException: thrown when file exists but can't be read
    - Both are wrapped in Exception with user-friendly messages

Test Plan:

getFileList() Tests:
    1. Should find carnivore.txt and cointelpro.txt in data folder
    2. Files should be returned in alphabetical order
    3. Should return exactly 2 files for current data folder

readFile() Tests:
    4. Should read carnivore.txt without errors
    5. Should read cointelpro.txt without errors
    6. Should read both files sequentially without issues
    7. Should throw exception when file doesn't exist

Read by index Tests:
    8. Should list files then read each by index

Testing Approach:
    - Tests use data files (carnivore.txt, cointelpro.txt)
    - Each method has multiple test cases
    - Error conditions are tested (missing files)
    - Integration test validates interaction with other components
