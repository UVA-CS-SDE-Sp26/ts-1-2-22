Program Control – Design & Testing Plan

Responsibility:
The ProgramControl component connects the command-line interface to the file handling
logic. It does not directly access files or cipher logic. It coordinates program flow.

Design:
- ProgramControl receives parsed command-line arguments from the main entry point.
- If no arguments are provided:
  - Request a list of available files from FileHandler
  - Display each file with a numbered index (01, 02, …)
- If a file number is provided:
  - Request the corresponding file contents from FileHandler
  - Output the returned text to the console
- If an invalid file number is provided:
  - Display an error message and exit gracefully

Dependencies:
- FileHandler (provided by Team Member B)
- CipherService (optional, injected if present)

Testing Strategy:
- FileHandler will be mocked in all tests
- Tests will verify:
  - Listing files when no arguments are provided
  - Displaying file contents when a valid index is provided
  - Graceful failure when an invalid index is provided
- No tests will access the filesystem directly

Exit Conditions:
- Program exits after listing files, displaying file contents, or showing an error message
